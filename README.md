# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple and stylish **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed** — all directly in the browser.  
The app stores tasks locally using **Local Storage**, so your data remains even after closing or refreshing the page. 💻✨

## 🧩 About the Project
This project was created as a **beginner-friendly exercise** to understand:
- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- JavaScript logic for dynamic web applications  

It’s a small but powerful project that demonstrates how interactive front-end apps work in real-world development.

### 🌍 Real-World Use Cases
While this is a learning project, **To-Do List applications** have wide real-world uses such as:
- 🧠 **Personal productivity apps** — managing daily routines, study goals, or gym schedules.  
- 🏢 **Team task trackers** — tracking employee or project tasks in small startups.  
- 🎯 **Student planners** — organizing assignments, exams, and deadlines.  
- 📅 **Freelancer workflows** — keeping track of client projects and deliverables.  
- 🛠️ **Prototype for larger apps** — serves as a base model for more advanced productivity tools with backend databases and APIs.

This project demonstrates how **basic frontend logic** can evolve into **real-world SaaS tools** like **Todoist**, **Microsoft To Do**, or **Google Tasks** with additional features such as authentication, synchronization, and cloud storage.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

This app runs **entirely in your browser** — no backend, database, or installations needed.

### 🧭 Steps:
1️⃣ **Open the project folder in VS Code.**  
2️⃣ Ensure these files exist together:
```
index.html  
main.css  
main.js  
```
3️⃣ Right-click `index.html` → select **“Open with Live Server.”**  
4️⃣ Your default browser will open the app automatically.  
5️⃣ Enter your name, add tasks, and start organizing your to-dos! 🧾✅  

💡 **Tip:**  
Your tasks are saved using the browser’s **Local Storage**,  
so they’ll remain even if you close or refresh the tab.
